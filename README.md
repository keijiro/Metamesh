**Metamesh** is a Unity package that generates primitive meshes. It acts as a
custom asset importer: Instead of pulling data from an input file, it reads
properties from a metafile and procedurally builds a mesh.

It currently provides the following shape generators:

- Plane
- Box
- Sphere (UV sphere)
- Icosphere
- Cylinder
- Rounded box
- Ring
- Disc
- Teapot
- Triangle
